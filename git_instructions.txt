	d) switch to the new branch with "git checkout [name-of-branch]"
	e) make all required changes and then once you are ready to commit your work: check status with "git status"
	f) "git add . " to put your changes into configuration management
	g) "git commit -m "[commit message/notes]"
	h) "git push --set-upstream origin [name-of-branch]" to create a remote branch on the server
